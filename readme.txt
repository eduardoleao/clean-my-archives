An easy-to-use shortcode for displaying post archives on your site.

== Description ==

The Clean My Archives plugin was developed because so many archives plugins were overly complicated.  I wanted something extremely simple to use that simply got the job done on my own [site's archives](http://justintadlock.com/archives).

Therefore, I created a simple `[clean-my-archives]` shortcode that you can place on any page (or any shortcode-ready area) and list your post archives by month and year.

This plugin also integrates with WordPress caching plugins.  So, long lists of archives can be cached for later use and loaded quickly.  If you have many years of blog posts, I highly recommend some sort of persistent caching or paginating your archives (see FAQ).

### Donations

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

### Why was this plugin created?

First and foremost, I wanted a simple archives solution for, what's now, over 12 years of blog posts.  You can check out [my archives](http://justintadlock.com/archives) to see how the plugin performs.

The second reason was to share my solution with other users who want the same simplicity.

### How do I use it?

Add the `[clean-my-archives]` shortcode to a shortcode-ready area, such as the page editor. That's it.  You have nothing more to do.

Of course, there are some other configuration options. Examples follow.

#### Limit the number of posts with the `limit` parameter:

	[clean-my-archives limit="100"]

#### Reverse the order with the `order` parameter (default is `DESC`):

	[clean-my-archives order="ASC"]

	[clean-my-archives order="DESC"]

#### Use the `year` parameter to limit to a year:

	[clean-my-archives year="2013"]

#### Use the `month` parameter to limit by month:

	[clean-my-archives month="12"]

#### Load specific post types with the `post_type` parameter:

	[clean-my-archives post_type="post"]

	[clean-my-archives post_type="post, page"]

#### Disable the comment count from showing:

	[clean-my-archives show_comment_count="0"]

#### Change the month and day date/time format

	[clean-my-archives format_month_year="F Y" format_post_date="d:"]

For a full list of formats, see the [PHP Date Formats](http://php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.date.php) guide.

### Does it support pagination?

Sort of.  Technically, it doesn't.  However, WordPress pages support pagination.  So, you could enter the following in your page editor to paginate by year.

	[clean-my-archives year="2013"]

	<!-- nextpage -->

	[clean-my-archives year="2012"]

	<!-- nextpage -->

	[clean-my-archives year="2011"]
